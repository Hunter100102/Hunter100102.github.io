        <h1>Pivoting Head and Swinging Armature Project</h1>
        <p>This project involved integrating two DC motors and a LIDAR radar detector with a Raspberry Pi 4 to create a pivoting head with the LIDAR detector and a swinging armature or "weapon". The purpose of this system was to disqualify contestants if they were still moving when the "head" turned around, facing the playing field, indicating a red light.</p>
        <p>I undertook this project alone, from conception to implementation. The main components and steps involved in this project included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Selection and integration of two DC motors and a LIDAR radar detector with a Raspberry Pi 4.</li>
            <li>Designing and constructing the pivoting head and swinging armature mechanism.</li>
            <li>Programming the Raspberry Pi 4 to control the motors and interpret data from the LIDAR detector.</li>
            <li>Testing and refining the system to ensure accurate and reliable operation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a visual demonstration of the project, please watch the video below:</p>
